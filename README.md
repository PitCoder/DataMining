### ID3
ID3 is the main project of this repository, in this project an implementation of the ID3 algorithm is been made. The algorithm is applied to a simulation of a music streaming application database (named Stopify as it is mention in other repository), allowing us to visualize in a better way raw data, therefore generating very basic business knowledge for decision taking.

ID3 stands for Iterative Dichotomizer 3. The ID3 algorithm was invented by Ross Quinlan. It builds a decision tree from a fixed set of examples and the resulting tree is used to classify future samples.
