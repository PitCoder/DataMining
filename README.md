### ID3 Algorithm
ID3 stands for Iterative Dichotomizer 3. The ID3 algorithm was invented by Ross Quinlan. It builds a decision tree from a fixed set of examples and the resulting tree is used to classify future samples.

The basic idea is to construct the decision tree by employing a top down, greddy search through the given data sets to test each attribute at every tree node.

#### What Are Decisions Trees?
Simply put, a decision tree is a tree with each branch represents a choice between a number of alternatives and each leaf node represents a decision.

#### Why use it in Machine Learning?
A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm (with a predefined target variable) that is mostly used in classification problems and works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. It is one of the most widely used and practical methods for inductive inference. (Inductive inference is the process of reaching a general conclusion from specific examples.)

#### What this project covers?
As the main project of the course the algorithm is applied to data stored in a database of a music streaming application named (Stopify). This with the purpose of obtaining a better visualization of the overall information structure and to generate very basic business knowledge for decision taking by mining and processing the raw data.
